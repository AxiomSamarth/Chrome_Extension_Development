## Features of this extension

This extension will help you customize the background of Google Home Page whose url will be *www.google.com*. There will be an icon displayed on the top right corner or your browser. Upon clicking it, it opens a popup window asking you to enter the URL of the image you would like to set as background. Facilitate it and click Modify background and it will change the background image of your Google Home Page. To unselect or bring back your white background, submit an empty input.
